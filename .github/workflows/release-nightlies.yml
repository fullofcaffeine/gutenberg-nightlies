      # This is mostly a hack to keep the releases in the right order in the releases page. Github
      # order by commit, but this repo doesn't really keep changes by default - it just fetches
      # from the core GB repo. To keep the activity and make sure the order is mantained, we
      # create a commit every time the action runs. This commit will be used for the next run
      # and will make sure the last nightly release stays at the top fo the releases, ordered
      # as the last one.
